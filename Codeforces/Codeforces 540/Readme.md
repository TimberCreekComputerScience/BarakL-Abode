# Problem A

Use a greedy approach since if the 2nd cup is more expensive than twice the cost of the 1st cup, we never wanna use the 2nd cup
Otherwise we use as many 2nd cups as possible and then finish it off with 1st cups.

# Problem B

Use a prefix sum to do this:
Take out an odd and your odds will be odds up to that point and evens from that point onward.
Take out an even and your evens will evens up to that point and odds from that point onward.
