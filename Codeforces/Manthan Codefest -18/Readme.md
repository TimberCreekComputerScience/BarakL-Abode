## Problem A

Answer is log base 2 of n

## Problem B

Sort and make all the numbers equal to k keeping track of how much you had to add or subtract

## Problem C

Only swap if numbers are adjacent and it'll be useful, otherwise you can just turn one off and turn the other on for the same or the same amount of moves.
