# Pass

For each integer given print "PASS" if it is greater than or equal to 6 to "FAIL" if it isn't


# Paper

For each pair of numbers, if the second number is divisible by 4, add second / 4 * first to the total sum, otherwise add (second / 4 + 1) * one to the total sum. Print out the total sum at the end.

# City

Use a brute force approach since the number of cities is very small (c<=20) so you can just do the math according to the problem to find the cost of accomodating all the teachers for every city.
Then you just have to print out the name of the city with the lowest cost, or if there are several with the same cost use a comparable to find and print the name of the city that comes first alphabetically.
